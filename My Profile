<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.0pt;text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FFB6A6;">Personal Information:</p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12.0pt;text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Melanie Lok (S3722982)</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12.0pt;text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="mailto:s3722982@student.rmit.edu.au">s3722982@student.rmit.edu.au</a></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">I was born in Australia on May, 1999. My ethnicity is half Cambodian and half Chinese.  </span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">After graduating from High School, I took a gap year then did half a semester in an Associates Degree of Science. I didn't enjoy it much so I dropped the course in Semester 2 and applied for a Bachelors Degree in Information Technology. </span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Fact about me: My hair hasn't been its natural colour in five years.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.0pt;text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FFB6A6;">Interest in IT:</span></p>
</p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">My main interest in IT is in programming. Although it is frustrating at times and can be very difficult, the end result is satisfying. Having your code run successfully gives a sense of accomplishment, which makes it so enjoyable.</span></p>
</p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">I have always been interested in IT since a young age. I have elder siblings who introduced me to games, so originally I was fascinated in game development, which progressed to coding as I got older and lost my interest in computer games.</span></p>
</p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">The spark for IT came from my dad, my brother and my sister-in-law, who all have careers in IT. They influenced me to chase an IT career.</span></p>
</p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Originally, I applied for Science at Melbourne University but I didn't make it in. RMIT has a good reputation for Information Technology hence it being my second choice. </span></p>
</p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">From my time at RMIT, I expect to obtain more knowledge about the IT world from peers and educators, gather more experience in coding as well as broaden my interests in IT and hopefully succeed in getting internships. </span></p>
</p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">My personality type is: ESFP - "The Entertainer". From my interpretation, the 'Extraverted' is characterised by my spontaneous and impulsive nature. I get energized by being around groups and I always enjoy having others company, which connects with 'Feeling'. I often seek to please and I am subjective, so my decisions are based on my values. I think with my heart rather than my head most the time, which explains 'Sensing' where I focus only on the present. I trust my instincts and go for what I know and feel is right. As for 'Percieving', my thinking process is quite random and I am often open to change. The unexpected usually doesn't bother me and enjoy working on many projects at once. My learning style is Tactile/Kinesthetic, which proves to be true as I retain information better when I work on it physically. Watching and listening helps but it is not the most effective for me, so I try different studying techniques to help me learn. As for my Big Five assessment, the results are extremely similar to my Myers-Briggs test.</span></p>

</p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">My personality type allows me to work well with a team. I am usually verbal and assertive so I'm not shy to hold back any ideas. I always cooperate and communicate with team members, and I am open to ideas that may challenge my own without having any conflict. However, my extraversion may be intimidating to some introverted individuals, or those who are philosophical, as our personalities clash. Our values different so it may be difficult to work with these personality types. </span></p>
</p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">When forming a team, I would try to work with those compatible with ESFP personality types. These include ISFP, ESTP, ESFP and ESFJ. I believe we would work well together due to these types having similar values, motivations, interests and approaches to life. If possible, I would avoid the personality types INTP, INTJ, INFJ and ENTJ.There are many clashes and challenges we face when it comes to general values so working with them will cause many disagreements. </span></p>
